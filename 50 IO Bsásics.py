"""
we are learning about the file reading so there are features in python by which we can write our file handeling
Question why we use file handeling


because when we are making our program  all data is stored in our ram when pc turn off all data will b gone but in the rom data is
not deletd so we store our data in the our rom



"r" it is used for reading it is a default mode
"w" it is used for writing
"a" it is used for adding content in our file just as append
"x" it is use if file is exsisting then it will giver erroe if not haveing it will create the file
"b" it is used for binary mode
"t" it is used for our text file it is also default in mode
"+" it is used for read and wrte both
