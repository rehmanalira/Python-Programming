"""
This file will be in the convert to exe folder


we use py convert to exe if we want to give our program to our frind
he not install the .py interpreter so this will help us

first we install pyinstaller with power shell
pip install pyinstaller and then we gave our file name

-->pyinstaller name.py
then it will automatically create .exe file
-> it gives many file if we want only exe file so we write
pyinstaller  --onefile name.exe

--> when we open our exe file it will run and then exit so better
is to open powershell and then type file name and enter
